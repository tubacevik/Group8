    <p>Arriving in Ravello is a treat in itself. One of Europe’s most scenic roads curves, loops and dives the full length of the coastline, passing the glamorous resorts of Sorrento, Positano and Amalfi. For centuries, this region has attracted the rich and famous, but nowhere more so than Ravello. Perched 350 metres above the sea, Ravello commands the greatest panorama of all.

        Grand Roman villas, ancient watchtowers and pretty residences spill lazily down towering hillsides towards the bay. Clear blue waters lull out to sea and the warm air carries the scent of lemons, olive groves and fragrant cypresses.
        
        Make your base high among the heavens at Caruso. Our Amalfi Coast hotel is steeped in history, uninterrupted coastal views and the kind of laid-back luxury Italy is famous for. You’ll find it’s the perfect place from which to explore Ravello, Amalfi Coast, Positano and beyond.</p>
